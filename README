= Code Quality Badges (Draft Status) =

I think that it should be really easy for consumers to look at
software they buy and to see if the software they want fits some
standard of quality.  In the future, I would like to see some kind of
official certification.  In order to facilitate this I would propose a
few badges that software projects could display to show their level of
quality.  The names and descriptions of these badges should also be
easy for customers to understand.

== Control Flow Coverage Badges ==

The program continuously tests separate cases of how their program
functions.

- Bronze: 25% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Silver: 50% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Gold: 75% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Platinum: 100% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.

== Control Flow Integrity Badge ==

The program state cannot be corrupted such that the program will jump
into an unexpected area of code.  In particular, the following attacks
are impossible.  The code cannot be attacked by
Return-Oriented-Programming attacks.  The code cannot be attacked by
Signal-Return-Oriented-Programming attacks.

== Principle of Least Privilege Badges ==

The program only does the least possible thing it can do.

- Platinum: The program only reads and writes from the standard input
  and output.

== Small Code Badges ==

The program is very small and easily auditable.  In numerous studies
the number of lines of code directly correlates with the number of
software bugs.

- Platinum: The program measures less than 1000 lines of code.
- Gold: The program measures less than 2000 lines of code.
- Silver: The program measures less than 4000 lines of code.
- Bronze: The program measures less than 8000 lines of code.

== No Signal Handlers Badge ==

Signal handlers are a specific Unix programming concept that are
famously difficult to understand and produce correct code with.  Not
having signal handlers completely stops the possibility of certain
kinds of security vulnerabilities.

== Single Thread Only Badge ==

Multithreading is a specific programming concept that is famously
difficult to understand and produce correct code with.  Not having
multiple threads of control and having only one single thread
completely stops the possiblity of certain kinds of security
vulnerabilities.
