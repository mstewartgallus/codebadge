= Code Quality Badges (Draft Status) =

I think that it should be really easy for consumers to look at
software they buy and to see if the software they want fits some
standard of quality.  In the future, I would like to see some kind of
official certification.  In order to facilitate this I would propose a
few badges that software projects could display to show their level of
quality.  The names and descriptions of these badges should also be
easy for customers to understand.

== Control Flow Coverage Badges ==

The program continuously tests separate cases of how their program
functions.

- Bronze: 25% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Silver: 50% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Gold: 75% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.
- Platinum: 100% of binary control flow paths are tested by unit tests.

== Control Flow Integrity Badge ==

The program state cannot be corrupted such that the program will jump
into an unexpected area of code.  In particular, the following attacks
are impossible.  The code cannot be attacked by
Return-Oriented-Programming attacks.  The code cannot be attacked by
Signal-Return-Oriented-Programming attacks.

== Principle of Least Privilege Badges ==

The program only does the least possible thing it can do.

- Platinum: The program only reads and writes from the standard input
  and output.
